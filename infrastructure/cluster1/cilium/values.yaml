# -- Allows to explicitly specify the IPv4 CIDR for native routing.
# When specified, Cilium assumes networking for this CIDR is preconfigured and
# hands traffic destined for that range to the Linux network stack without
# applying any SNAT.
# Generally speaking, specifying a native routing CIDR implies that Cilium can
# depend on the underlying networking stack to route packets to their
# destination. To offer a concrete example, if Cilium is configured to use
# direct routing and the Kubernetes CIDR is included in the native routing CIDR,
# the user must configure the routes to reach pods, either manually or by
# setting the auto-direct-node-routes flag.
