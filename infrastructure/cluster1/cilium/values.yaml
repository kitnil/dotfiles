# Each individual node is made aware of all pod IPs of all other nodes and
# routes are inserted into the Linux kernel routing table to represent
# this. If all nodes share a single L2 network, then this can be taken care of
# by enabling the option auto-direct-node-routes: true. Otherwise, an
# additional system component such as a BGP daemon must be run to distribute
# the routes. See the guide Using Kube-Router to Run BGP (deprecated) on how
# to achieve this using the kube-router project.
#
# -- Enable installation of PodCIDR routes between worker
# nodes if worker nodes share a common L2 network segment.
