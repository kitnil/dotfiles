My configuration files primarily for FOSS applications.

To setup them I use [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][GNU Stow]] like so:

  : $ cd dotfiles
  : $ stow DIRECTORY

Some files you already have could conflict.  Stow will tell you which
are.  So make sure to backup them moving somewhere with:

  : $ mv CONFLICT_CONFIG_FILE BACKUP_DIRECTORY

After changing file:fiore/natsu/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list
  : $ update-desktop-database ~/.local/share/applications/

* Usage

  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
    ~/src/guix/pre-inst-env\
        guix package\
        -L $HOME/dotfiles\
        -m $HOME/dotfiles/fiore/manifests/guix-collection-manifest.scm
  #+END_SRC
